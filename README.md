# Rust Project
Copyright (c) 2019 Robin Gearn <rgearn@pdx.edu>, James Wescott <james@wescottdesign.com>

This project starts with an exploration of A template for building applications for ARM 
    Cortex-M microcontrollers. This project is developed and maintained by the [Cortex-M team][team]


This project is also supported with the help of Tim Wescott <tim@wescottdesign.com>, 


The Timer runs on a STM32 F3 board.

It will be a timer with a simple knob-button interface.
We will set the time with the knob. Start, stop, clear with the button.

The display will show the time remaining in binary to start with.  If
we have time to add a standard lcd display the time will be displayed in standard
HMS format.
